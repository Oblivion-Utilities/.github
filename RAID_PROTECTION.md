<h2 align="center">How does Raid Protection work?</h2>

**This command is still work in progress and might have some problems. Please report any issues to our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv).  
When an Moderator or higher detects that a raid is happening, all you gotta do is say ***/raid***. This will lock all channels in which you can't write. Now Moderators got time to detect who's a raider and who isn't. Vension will also timeout anyone who participated in the raid, meaning spamming, severe profanity, and other. When you are done cleaning the server type ***/raid*** to unlock it again.**
