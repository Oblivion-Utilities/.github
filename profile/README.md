[^4]: Want suggestions from your community? Set up a channel and let your community speak their mind. [Administrators](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) can accept or deny suggestions.
[^5]: Want people to get rewarded for their [activity](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv)? The more people interact with your server the more [**EXP**](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) they gain. You can even set up roles to be rewarded for reaching a certain level.
[^6]: Want a unique verification system for your server? We got three variants to choose from: [Modal](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv), [via. Text](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv), or [by Reaction](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv).

    The person's username they are reporting, the reason they are making the report, and valid proof.  
    All reports will [automatically be logged](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) in a selected channel including the person's username who used the command so people can't abuse it.
[^8]: If people apply to your server a box will [pop up](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) for them where they have to enter certain information:  
    Their username, the reason they are applying, What they can bring to the server, how active they can be, and maybe more questions in the future.
