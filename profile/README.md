### Verification Command
- Set up a unique verification system for your server. Just type **/verify** and select the type of verification you want.
<p align="center">
<sub> You can currently choose from 3 verification system variants. </sub>
</p>

- **Modal** [^1]
  - **Short explanation:** The user verifying must enter a password into the pop up box.
- **via. Text** [^2]
  - **Short explanation:** The user verifying must send a certain phrase to the channel.
- **Reaction** [^3]
  - **Short explanation:** The user verifying must react with the emoji below the message.

[^1]: If you choose the modal variant, you can set up a channel where the user has to enter an automatically generated password via. a pop up box.  
  If they get it wrong they have a 60 second cooldown before being able to retry to verify. That is optional tho, you can find a full guide [here.](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv)
[^2]: If you choose the text variant, the user verifying has to send a certain phrase into the verification channel.  
  If the bot detects that the user wrote the correct phrase they will receive the selected role and won't be able to write in the channel again.  
  Normally the phrase is just the persons **username** but if it changes you will be notified automatically by the bot. You can also change it via. the [Dashboard](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) if you don't like it.
[^3]: If you choose the reaction variant, the user verifying must react with an emoji below the verification message.  
  In order for this to work you must have a message in the verification channel and type **/verify** and select **react** and let the bot do the rest.
[^4]: How the report command works: Users type **/report** and a box pops up where the users have to enter various information.  
  • Username of the person being reported.  
  • Reason of the report.  
  • Valid proof, optional but you can set it to required via. our Dashboard.  
  Any reports will be logged in a selected channel including the person who used the command so people won't be able to abuse it.
[^5]: The profile command shows an embed of the users profile, it shows information including:  
  • Username.  
  • User ID.  
  • Avatar Link.  
  • Account Creation Date.  
  • Server Join Date.  
  • Current Nickname.  
  • Recent Warnings, Kicks, Bans, and other moderations.  
  And other non-privacy invading information. This command is manually set to be only avaiable for moderators, but you can change this via. our Dashboard.
