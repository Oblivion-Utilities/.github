[^5]: Want people to get rewarded for their [activity](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv)? The more people interact with your server the more [**EXP**](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) they gain. You can even set up roles to be rewarded for reaching a certain level.
[^6]: Want a unique verification system for your server? We got three variants to choose from: [Modal](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv), [via. Text](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv), or [by Reaction](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv).
[^7]: People can report other users with just one command. After they entered the command a box will [pop up](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) where they have to enter:  
    The person's username they are reporting, the reason they are making the report, and valid proof.  
    All reports will [automatically be logged](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) in a selected channel including the person's username who used the command so people can't abuse it.
[^8]: If people apply to your server a box will [pop up](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) for them where they have to enter certain information:  
    Their username, the reason they are applying, What they can bring to the server, how active they can be, and maybe more questions in the future.  
    All applications will be [automatically logged](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv) in the channel of your choice.

    how many server boosts, how many animated or static emojis you have,  
    your moderation level, how many moderated members, how many channels you have, and more.
