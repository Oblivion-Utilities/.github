Do you have knowledge with **Discord Js14** and want to earn some money? Then you're at the right place!
In order to become a contributor,  
go ahead and join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/r2XgZRFnpv). If you are active and make multiple suggestions that get accepted, you will most likely get contacted by an Administrator, asking if you would like to become an Contributor. If you are an contributor, for each suggestion that you make that gets added you will be paid $30. But, you can also apply to be a contributor, at the moment our applications are closed. So that means all contributors are handpicked. Stay up to date to get notified when our applications open.
